    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.  </li>
        <li>Guanciale: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you can't find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
