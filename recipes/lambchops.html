    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This pistachio-crusted rack of lamb has an interesting flavor and texture. A rack of lamb may be a little pricey but no more so than other special-occasion meats like prime rib, beef tenderloin, or goose.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks of lamb, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chopped pistachio nuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Generously season each rack of lamb with herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place lamb into the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Stir pistachios, bread crumbs, melted butter, and olive oil together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread mustard over the fatty side of lamb, then press pistachio mixture into mustard.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and lamb is pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
        <li>Transfer lamb to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
